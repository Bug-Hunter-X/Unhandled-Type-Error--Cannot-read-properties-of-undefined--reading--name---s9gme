# React Native: Unhandled Type Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: attempting to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  The error typically manifests as `Unhandled Type Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')` or a similar message.

## Problem

The issue arises when asynchronous operations, such as fetching data, are used within a functional component.  The component renders before the `useState` hook has a chance to update the state variable with the fetched data, resulting in an attempt to access `undefined`.

## Solution

The solution involves conditional rendering or using optional chaining to safely handle the case where the state variable is still `null` or `undefined`.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` (or `npx react-native run-ios`).
4. Observe the error in the console and the application's behavior.

## Solution Implementation

The solution is implemented in `bugSolution.js`.
