This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This is common when using asynchronous operations like fetching data from an API within a functional component.  Before the `useState` hook has a chance to set the initial value, the component tries to render, leading to `undefined` being used, causing errors.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
      const jsonData = await response.json();
      setData(jsonData);
    };

    fetchData();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      {/* Error: Trying to access data before it's set */}
      <Text>{data.name}</Text> 
    </View>
  );
};
```
